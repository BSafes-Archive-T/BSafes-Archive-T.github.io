## 1 INTRODUCTION
The planning, design, development and implementation of home-based smart technology to enhance the quality of life of a particular individual is a complex and evolving challenge, and these complexities can be amplified when end users are older or have a disability. Unique ethical, privacy and safety implications arise for people who are reliant on technology due to health conditions or disabilities. The aim of home-based smart technology is to provide utility to an end user by enhancing their independence and improving quality of life, but if attention has not also been paid to ethical and privacy issues, the end user can have difficult and unfair choices to make.

While ethical approaches have been applied to particular aspects and phases of smart home-based technology design and evaluation there is a need for a practical ethical framework that spans the technology life cycle and that can address the specific requirements of people with sensory, physical or cognitive impairments. In this position paper, we argue that co-design or participatory techniques must form part of a larger multi stakeholder ethical framework for the design of inclusive smart spaces for older people or people with disabilities.
