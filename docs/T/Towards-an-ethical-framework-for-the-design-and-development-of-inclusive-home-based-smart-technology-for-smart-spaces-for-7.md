## 7 CONCLUSIONS
The development of inclusive, home-based smart technology presents many unique ethical challenges, and when this is allied with these systems being developed for older adults and people with disabilities, the ethical concerns and considerations grow significantly. In this paper we have outlined a framework for navigating some of these ethical issues using a range of techniques from Software Engineering, Education, and Research Methods to produce a coherent new ethics driven approach that we have entitled “The 5D Framework” that puts the user at the heart of the process.
