From a once largely unknown preacher with a YouTube channel, Steven Anderson’s media presence has grown sizably in less than a decade. From his pulpit at Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona (Independent Fundamental Baptist, or IFB), his vitriolic preaching on religious and social issues has garnered public attention. On a local area news broadcast, Anderson went on record saying that the state should execute homosexuals.<sup>1</sup> He also gained national notoriety by praying for the death of President Barack Obama.<sup>2</sup> Praying for the death of a president is a far cry from how many conservative Christians usually, at least in theory, discuss prayer for those in authority, namely praying for the well-being of their leaders or praying that their leaders would follow God’s commands.<sup>3</sup> He was even featured in a BBC mini-documentary that covered his daily life and ministry, entitled “America’s Hate-Preachers.”<sup>4</sup> Interest in Anderson’s YouTube videos has grown in part due to increased production quality. Paul Wittenberger, owner of Framing the World, a small-time film production company, joined Anderson’s cause sometime in the last decade.

Steven Anderson is a conspiracist who is also a fundamentalist Christian. He melds his post-tribulation premillennialism with conspiracies about the United Nations, the 9/11 attacks, translations of the Bible, the Masonic Lodge, and more.<sup>5</sup> In recent years, Anderson has shown an increased interest in talking about the relationship between Christianity, Judaism, and the State of Israel, culminating in a film entitled *Marching to Zion* (2015). In this film, Anderson, who firmly embraces replacement theology, also known as supersessionism, championed a wide range of antisemitic stereotypes.<sup>6</sup> *Marching to Zion* did not substantively address the Holocaust, however. Whether simply curious about his thoughts or as a counterpoint to his claims, Anderson’s viewers brought up the Holocaust, and Anderson felt compelled to share his views. The preacher produced a nearly 40-minute video, “Did the Holocaust Really Happen?,”<sup>7</sup> in which he espoused what Deborah Lipstadt has called “hardcore” Holocaust denial, “den[ying] the facts of the Holocaust” in an “outright and forceful fashion.”<sup>8</sup> Though his “scientific” evidence for the “Holocaust

hoax” or “Holocaust myth,” as he often refers to the Holocaust, is mostly a regurgitation of the pseudoscientific arguments made by a more established group of Holocaust deniers, Anderson adds a spiritual dimension to Holocaust denial to make it attractive to Christian viewers.<sup>9</sup> In the following article, I argue this very claim—Anderson presents fellow Christians with arguments for Holocaust denial and sets Holocaust denial in a spiritual framework. He depicts Christianity and Judaism in cosmic battle, such that the “Holocaust myth” hinders the spread of Christianity. By examining the spiritual importance Anderson gives Holocaust denial, scholars gain insight into how individuals refashion genocide denial for their own needs and repackage it for particular audiences, an example of “how conspiracy narratives are mobilized within specific religious groups.”<sup>10</sup>

I begin this article by discussing Christian conspiracists and theoretical issues in analyzing Holocaust denial on the web. I continue by briefly describing *Marching to Zion*, its production, narrative, and theological goals.<sup>11</sup> While Anderson does not espouse Holocaust denial in this film, *Marching to Zion* shows Anderson’s connection to Texe Marrs,<sup>12</sup> a Christian conspiracist more actively involved in a wider network of what I call theocentric Christian conspiracists. I then consider Anderson’s post-*Marching to Zion* Holocaust denial video, “Did the Holocaust Really Happen?” Through a close reading of this video, I show how Anderson gives Holocaust denial a spiritual meaning because, he believes, the Holocaust negatively impacts one of his ultimate goals, “soul-winning,” or bringing lost souls to faith in Jesus. Though Anderson and fellow Christian conspiracists have a special theologically-driven interest in Jews and the Holocaust, their case shows how the discourse related to denying a particular genocide morphs when applied in specific contexts.
