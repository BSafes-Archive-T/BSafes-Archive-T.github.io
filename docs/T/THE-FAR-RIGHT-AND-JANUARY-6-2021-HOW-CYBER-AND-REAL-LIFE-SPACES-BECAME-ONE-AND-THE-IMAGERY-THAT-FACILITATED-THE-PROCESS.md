## ABSTRACT

The growing presence of the far right in both internet and physical spaces is of concern because of the associated violence and civil unrest. The presence of the far right on the internet is historical and persistent. It is used by the far right movement to engage, radicalize, fellowship, plan and execute events, some of which are violent. This thesis explores the ways in which the far right uses online spaces and offline spaces in tandem, and how the use of imagery facilitates this process. To do this a visual and audio analysis was conducted on 100 videos posted to the social media site Parler on January 6, 2021. The videos were analyzed for far right related imagery and songs, chants, and narration to help shed light on how cyberspace and real life space not only worked in tandem, but in this event, became one and the same. The analysis found that while certain high profile far right groups kept their imagery visibility low, America First had a visible presence and they engaged in rhetoric decrying globalization and immigrants, which is of concern as it is the unifying theme nurturing growing global ties among the far right. The results also demonstrated the tension between pro law enforcement and antigovernment far right groups as well as the far rights weaponization of patriotic symbols.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to recognize and thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement. I never thought, almost 15 years after completing my undergraduate work and teaching credential program, that when I returned to university it would turn out to be in the middle of an historic pandemic.

Thank you to my friends and professors, especially Dr. Grisham, Dr. Pytell, and Dr. Khan, in the Social Science and Globalization program. I learned so much and I value the time I spent with you. To the ladies of the “Thesis Support” group text, Melissa, Mayra, and Rubi, thank you for the laughs, the help, and the encouragement.

To my mother, April Bachelder, and my sisters Cody and Ashley Bachelder, thank you for always believing in me and encouraging my academic studies.

To my children, Xavier, Alex, and Amaia LaMar, I missed you so much as the pandemic made visits nearly impossible. The family texts and Facetime visits helped so much, and you never doubted my success. I love you all so much.

To my rock, my life partner, my husband, my love, Rodney LaMar. Your unwavering support, love, encouragement, and ability to make me laugh when I most needed it, made this process possible. Thank you, I love you, and I so look forward to our next 30 years together.
