## Limitations and Future Studies
One of the limitations of this research is the lack of reporting or accurate reporting when there are cases of femicide or missing women. Gathering the numbers and accurate data was one of the most challenging aspects of the research since many articles estimated figures and periods (Chin & Schultz, 2020). The missing number of women is unknown and the lack of accountability by local officials makes it hard to obtain accurate data (OHCHR, 2012). Many women having to walk to the maquilas has also made them prone to human trafficking which is another heavily underreported issue that could be linked to the maquiladora industry (Eagan, 2020). Another limitation is the impact of NAFTA changes after 2016 and their effect on the rate of femicide if any. Data from after 2016 has not been published or yet become easily accessible, but could be an area for further research.

Femicide and gender violence is an issue that affects the country. Cases like the ones mentioned in earlier sections can be found all across the country. Nationwide data on the femicides and gender abuses in the maquilas, and institutions that protect labor and women’s rights is another area that should be researched. This would hopefully allow people to gain a deeper understanding of the issue and how it affects a large portion of the population. Providing resources allows for women to be aware of the help they can receive and how there are places that protect their rights. Another area for analysis is the role of the United States in exacerbating the effects of cheap labor and gendered professions. To what extent is Mexico responsible for the murders and inequalities found in these factories? Because of trade agreements and ownership of the factories, the United States and Mexico’s economies are deeply intertwined and their overlaps and differences would be another important aspect to note in further research (Staudt, 2018).
