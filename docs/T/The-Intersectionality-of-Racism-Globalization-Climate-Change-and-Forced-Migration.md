## Abstract
The purpose of this paper was to contextualize the intersectionality of racism, globalization, climate change, and forced immigration. The paper focuses on conversations from numerous organizations and individuals working to deal with the aforementioned challenges. In addition to highlighting the challenges faced by many immigrants, or would-be immigrants, the paper pinpoints approaches being adopted by community organizations and social movements to end persecution and forced migration. The recommendations put forth by the stakeholders who are engaged in addressing these issues relate to the need for building a policy-relevant agenda and strategy for solving the relevant challenges. Thus, leading to a positive and lasting change in the relevant space.
