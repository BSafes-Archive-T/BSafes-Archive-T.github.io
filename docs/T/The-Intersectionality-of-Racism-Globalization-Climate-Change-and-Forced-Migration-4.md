## Conclusion
The preceding discussion on the intersectionality of racism, globalization, climate change, and forced migration based on conversations from numerous organizations and individuals (stakeholders) working to solve these related problems. The expected outcome of the discussion was to develop an easy-to-understand report and paper by embracing the message of those who are on the ground doing the work and those who are suffering from state-sanctioned inhumane laws and activities. The problems discussed throughout this paper highlight the need for countries to actively create alternatives for vulnerable communities. AMI focuses on helping marginalized communities whose voices are drowned out by those willing to uphold profits and greed over justice and humanity. A complete dismantling of structures that disregard the plight of communities plagued with climate disasters, food insecurity, racism, and xenophobic practices is the best outcome for rural and global sustainability.
