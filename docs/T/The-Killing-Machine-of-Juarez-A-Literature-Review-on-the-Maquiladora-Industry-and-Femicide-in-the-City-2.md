## Methodological Approach
A literature review was conducted to understand the context and the ties between the maquiladora industry and the rampant femicides in the city. To understand the rise of the maquila industry and the connection between the gender violence that it has fostered, the review contains multiple scholarly articles, films, news articles, podcasts, book chapters as well as case studies. The literature review used the political and social response to the murders as a way to understand the impact of the femicides in the city.

A multitude of sources are used to fully understand the importance of femicide, what it is defined as, and how it is presented in the city as well as other practices in the maquila that have had extreme impacts on women. The violence against women and the lack of response to the issue will also be mentioned to understand the impunity and lack of social support in these spaces. Using various forms of literature, socioeconomic factors are explained and the full effect of the maquilas in Mexican society as well as how since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted, Mexico underwent enormous changes. The goal is to understand how the changes in the Mexican economy fueled the creation of more maquilas that sought unskilled labor and placed women in hazardous conditions and the consequences that these conditions led to.
